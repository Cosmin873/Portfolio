Yes! We’re happy to custom-make your ring in any size you need. Just reach out to us, and we’ll take care of the rest.<br/><br/>

Can this ring be made in 18K gold or Platinum?<br/>

Absolutely. This design can be crafted in 18K solid gold or Platinum by special request. Additional fees may apply—please contact us for a custom quote.<br/><br/>

How do I determine my ring size?<br/>

For the most accurate sizing, we recommend visiting a local jewelry store. DIY methods at home can work, but professional sizing is always best—especially for a piece you’ll wear every day.<br/><br/>

Are your diamonds ethically sourced?<br/>

Yes. All of our diamonds and gemstones are ethically sourced, so you can feel confident about the origins of your jewelry.<br/><br/>

Is this ring made with real gold? Will it tarnish or change color?<br/>

Yes—it’s crafted from solid 14k gold, not plated or vermeil. That means it won’t tarnish, fade, or discolor over time with normal wear.<br/><br/>

We love creating meaningful pieces. If you'd like a different gemstone or a custom variation of this design, contact us and we’ll see what’s possible.<br/><br/>
