    faq: `Can I order a size larger or smaller?

Yes! We’re happy to custom-make your ring in any size you need. Just reach out to us, and we’ll take care of the rest.

Can this ring be made in 18K gold or Platinum?

Absolutely. This design can be crafted in 18K solid gold or Platinum by special request. Additional fees may apply—please contact us for a custom quote.

How do I determine my ring size?

For the most accurate sizing, we recommend visiting a local jewelry store. DIY methods at home can work, but professional sizing is always best—especially for a piece you’ll wear every day.

Are your diamonds ethically sourced?

Yes. All of our diamonds and gemstones are ethically sourced, so you can feel confident about the origins of your jewelry.

Is this ring made with real gold? Will it tarnish or change color?

Yes—it’s crafted from solid 14k gold, not plated or vermeil. That means it won’t tarnish, fade, or discolor over time with normal wear.

Can I request a different gemstone or modify the design?

We love creating meaningful pieces. If you'd like a different gemstone or a custom variation of this design, contact us and we’ll see what’s possible.

How long will it take to receive my custom ring?

Custom pieces generally take 4-6 weeks to make before they ship. If you’re working with a specific date in mind, let us know and we’ll do our best to accommodate.

Do you offer engraving?

Yes, we can engrave a special message inside the band for an additional fee.`,

    care_instructions: `To keep your piece looking like new, follow these simple care guidelines:

Mix warm water with a few drops of mild dish soap. Use a soft-bristled toothbrush to gently remove any buildup.
Avoid harsh chemicals and abrasives like hairspray, lotion, chlorine, and makeup. These can wear down metals and diminish shine over time, etc.; exposure will dull the shine of precious metals over time.
Check for any loose stones or prongs. If something feels off, pause wearing the piece and contact our customer care team for support.
Remove your jewelry before physical activities and store it in a soft pouch or separate compartment to avoid scratches.`,
