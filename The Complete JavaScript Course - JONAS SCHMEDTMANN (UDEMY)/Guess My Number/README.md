# Guess My Number

It is a game in which the computer will automatically choose a number from 1 to 20. You are supposed to guess that number by entering it in the input field on the left side of the screen. Hints will be shown after each time you press check. They will be wheter your number is too low, or too high. When your number is the same as computer's the screen will turn green and the score will be stored as highscore if it is the highest. You can play again if you press the "Again!" button.

Have fun! :)
