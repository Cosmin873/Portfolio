# Pig Game

It is a 2 players game in which the one who reaches 100 points wins. The rules are: spin the dice as many times as you want, the poins will add together. Press hold in order to store the points. After the hold button is pressed and points gets stored, it will switch to the other player. In case the dice will be 1, the points that aren't stored will be lost and it will switch to the other player.

Have fun! :)
